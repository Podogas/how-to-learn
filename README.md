## Description:
This was the first training project of Yandex practicum courses.
This page was grounded on project brief in which we have got sizes, names of blocks and elements, and other helpful information such as hints about common mistakes, methods to use, and so on.
This is a simple single html page without any functionality, except that you can click on links and spectate on rotating triangle


However, in the process of completing this task, I have learned a lot of important basic things such as:
* HTML
  * Some metatags and Head tag functions.
  * Semantic html5 elements such as: header footer section nav cite.
  * Human friendly Html formatting.
* HTML flow
  * position property and elements behavior with different values. 
  * display property 
  * Margin/padding/border.
  * Element's overflow
* CSS
  * Font-family
  * import
  * alignment
  * z-index
  * pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
* BEM class naming convention
## In this project I was using following technologies and methods:
* flexbox
* grid-layout
* Animation and transform
* BEM naming
* BEM file structure
